FRONTEND 

# Task 1
Add the styling to 'frontend-iinterview' to create the Layout as in the image: `result-of-css.png`

#Task 2 
Using JavaScript create the layout as presented in `result-of-js.png` dynamiclly using RestAPI from a json file: `questions.json`

#Task 3
In order to display the DOT marks on the left we need to combine `questions.json` with  `submissions.josn`. 
Which hase 3 status, `incorrect`, `correct`, `partialy_correct`, if is not present on respone it means is `unatempted`.


Bonus point:

- (After solution) Can you make these elements draggable by the green border?

- On title add correct answers / total questions

- How would group them by category or randomly ?
